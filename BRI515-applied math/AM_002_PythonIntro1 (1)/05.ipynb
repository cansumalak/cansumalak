First, because it is less typing work, but second, and most importantly, it is because list comprehensions are actually faster than the list append code.

With the list comprehension, python can gather all elements together, before assigning the result in one go to the new variable, which makes this faster - especially for larger lists!\n","\n","Let's try to use the jupyter \"magic\" function **timeit** to measure this advantage.
