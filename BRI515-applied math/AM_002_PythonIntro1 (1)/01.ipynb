It is an Open Source effort. Guido van Rossum still is Pythonâ€™s principal author, but thousands of other contributors have helped to extend its functionality.\n","\n","Python is a so-called \"script language\", which sets it apart from compiled languages like C++ or Java. It is (relatively) easy to learn, yet provides a reasonable level of coding abstraction and effectiveness, which has made it one of the most common languages in coding as of date.\n","\n","Python is particularly attractive as there exist numerous packages for extending its functionality further. For this reason, most Python installations come with built-in package managers (pip, conda) etc. Because of the various dependencies of these packages, the installation of more comprehensive coding environments for Python are often a good idea. The most common one perhaps in our context is Anaconda (available at www.anaconda.com), which is specifically geared towards scientific computing and contains a lot of packages out of the box, which will be useful for data science, deep learning, etc.\n","\n","The following iPython notebooks were (lightly) modified from a set of lectures built and extended from sources from Rajeth Kumar and Valentin Haenel.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"58Dmfknkv4yY"},"source":["# The Zen Of Python"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"ce1NQqClv4yZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["import this"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"m88l_19Vv4yc"},"source":["# Operators\n","\n","Python of course includes all standard operators to conduct arithmetic operations on numbers."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"eBgPglA3v4yc"},"source":["## Arithmetic Operators"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"ETDSSh9Ov4yc"},"source":["| Symbol | Task Performed |\n","|----|---|\n","| +  | Addition |\n","| -  | Subtraction |\n","| /  | division |\n","| %  | mod |\n","| *  | multiplication |\n","| //  | floor division |\n","| **  | to the power of |"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"pqaxj6Zbv4yc"},"outputs":[],"source":["1+2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"6KfeoiTiv4yd"},"outputs":[],"source":["2-1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"6Vxi7_pMv4yd"},"outputs":[],"source":["1*2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"2TS4EvRXv4yd"},"outputs":[],"source":["1/2"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true,"id":"DPewQHpzv4yd"},"source":["Why is this zero?\n","\n","This is because both the numerator and denominator are **integers**, hence an integer value is returned.
