# THIS FILE FOR CALCULATING MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF EXERCISE, WEIGHT, HEART RATE VARIABLES OF PARTICIPANTS
# AND PRINTING THE PLOTS AND MAKING COMPARISONS
#FIRST PLOT:
# The first figure consists of three subplots, each representing a variable (Heart rate, Weight, Exercise). Scatter plots used to illustrate the distribution of data points for each variable.
# Dots represent the original data points, red horizontal lines represent the mean, and blue dashed lines represent the mean Â± standard deviation.
# Custom ticks are added to the x-axis for better visualization.

#SECOND PLOT
# The second figure also consists of three subplots, each representing a comparison within variables.

# Variable mean and standard Deviation results also printed for each variable
# NOTE: before starting to write code, I installed numpy module in terminal using "pip install numpy" and "pip install matplotlib/python -m pip install --upgrade pip"

COMMENTS FOR PLOTS
     FIRST PLOT SHOWS:
 HeartRate(bpm) has a mean of 74.6 and a standard deviation of 10.83 with minimum 96; maximum 95 data results
 Weight(kg) has a mean of 73.13 and a standard deviation of 12.19 with minimum 55; maximum 101 data results
 Exercise(hrs) shows results with a mean of 3.73 and a standard deviation of 2.33 with minimum 0.1; maximum 8.5 data results
 The standard deviations of the variables, heart rate and weight, indicate a more homogeneous trend in terms of the variability of individual heart rate and weight data around their means. Conversely, the variable 'exercise' shows a higher standard deviation, implying a more heterogeneous trend toward its mean which is indicative of a more diverse distribution.


    SECOND PLOT SHOWS:
There is no  linear relationship among the three comparisons: heart rate-weight, heart rate-exercise, and weight-exercise. Interestingly, a decreasing trend is observed across the data points between 70 to 80 when examining the x-axis in all three comparisons.
In the heart rate-weight comparison, an increasing trend is evident. 
Conversely, there is a decreasing trend in the heart rate-exercise comparison and a slight decreasing trend in the weight-exercise comparison.
Even though we don't know about participants age, gender and stress rate (which is also influences variables like weight and heart rate) and also small amount of participants, it can be observed that weight has a positive correlation with heart rate, while exercise exhibits a negative correlation. (further analyses must done to be sure)
However, a slight decrease is noted in weight when exercise hours are shortened. Given the high standard deviation in exercise,  we may conclude that individual differences may play a more significant role in exercise duration than weight  impacting exercise hours.
